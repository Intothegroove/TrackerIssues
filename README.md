# Polyend Tracker Issue Tracking

This repository exists to enable community members to submit and track
known issues with the Polyend Tracker.  You can submit bug reports
**as well as** feature requests here.

## The rules are simple

* **Check for duplicates** before submitting your bug report or idea.
  We might get a little grumpy if you don't.

* **Always** refer to the particular firmware version you're currently
  using.  This is crucial for us to determine if the problem is still
  there or whether it's been already fixed.

* A **clear English description** makes it easier for us to understand you.
  Please don't ignore the provided template!

## Attachments

Provide as many **attachments** as possible with your bug report.
We're especially looking for:

* direct links to videos where you show the bug;

* pictures (you can drag them into the edit box when submitting your
  bug report);

* zipped projects from the SD card.

## Thanks!

Through your help and support we'll be able to make the Polyend Tracker
the best instrument it can!
